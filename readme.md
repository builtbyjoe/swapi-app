## SWAPI Test Application

This is a quick demo project using the SW API to display a list of people, including relationships with planets and starships. The project uses the following technology and libraries:

- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- Axios
- ChakraUI 

## Install and setup

To install dependancies:

`npm install`  

To start the development server:

`npm run dev`

`npm test`   

## Reflection

- The application is aimed for desktop use
- The project was worked on for 3-4 hours with the focus on creating something fully functional and clean
- It was a fun challenge and very much something I enjoy
